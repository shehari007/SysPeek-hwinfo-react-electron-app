## Deployment

Deployment is never been easy before, package.json is already configured for every platform (Window, Linux, MacOs). Just need to run build commands for each platform as follows:
## For Windows
```bash
npm run electron:package:win
```
## For Linux
```bash
npm run electron:package:linux
```
## For MacOS
```bash
npm run electron:package:mac
```
Running these commands will give you a package file (Windows->NSIS .exe) || (Linux->.deb) || (macOS->.dmg).
